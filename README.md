NeuroTools
==========

NeuroTools is a collection of tools to support all tasks associated with the
analysis of neural activity - from neurophysiology to neural simulations.

NeuroTools is written in Python, and works best with PyNN, or one of the growing
list of simulation engines with a Python front-end such as NEURON, NEST, PCSIM,
FACETS Neuromorphic VLSI, Brian, MOOSE/GENESIS, Neurospaces/GENESIS. NeuroTools
provides modules to facilitate simulation setup, parameterization and
instrumentation, and data management, analysis and visualization. The
data-related tools are equally suited to analysis of experimental data, although
that is not the primary motivation for their development.

NeuroTools aims to:

1. increase the productivity of individual modellers by automating, simplifying,
   and establishing best-practices for common tasks,

2. increase the productivity of the neuroscience modelling community by reducing
   the amount of code duplication across simulation communities, 

3. increase the reliability of data analysis tools leveraging Linus's law:
   "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
